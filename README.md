# Covid-19 Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts the spread of Covid-19 using global time series data. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization steps in Python.

## Project Structure
- `Covid-19 Analysis & Prediction.ipynb` / `covid-19_analysis_prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for analysis and prediction
- `time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv`: Confirmed cases data
- `time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv`: Deaths data
- `time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv`: Recovered cases data
- `CoronaVirus Data.csv`: Processed output data
- `Covid Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard 

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells to process and analyze the data.
3. The output CSV will be generated in the project directory.
